# goGeet
## About Laravel
goGeet is my goals management app. I never really found anything that I like. And yes, I know there's thousands of apps for this, but this one is exactly how I like it. 

Here are the key features:

 - Create your personal principles
    - Principles are objectives that drive the creation of Missions / Goals / Reminders. They are much more broad and high level than even a mission. For example one of my principles is "Being Healthy". How does one accomplish that? Through creating missions and then goals, and reminders all to live up to the principle of Being Healthy. 
 - Create your missions
    - Missions are broad and not definitively measurable. They are high level “goals” that I want to achieve, but don’t have a specific measurable result, other than possibly (not in most cases) being complete. A good example are some of the goals I have at Path Medical like; Learn HL7, Learn HIPAA. These are broad, when is “learn” complete? So, these are missions, not specifically goals. When all missions within a principle are complete, that does not indicate that my principle is complete. Principles are not completable, they go on.
 - Create your goals
    - Goals are specific and measurable. So using the example mission from above; Learn HIPAA, the goals to accomplish that mission would be to read the HIPAA For Dummies book.
      
      A good analogy to describe the difference between a mission and a goal is war. When you’re in a war, or going to war, you have a mission as a country. That mission will usually be to defeat your enemy. So the mission, again is, defeat your enemy. The goals to accomplish that mission will likely be numerous; take that bridge, take that hill top, take that city, kill their leader, put down the rebellion. And when all the goals are accomplished, you fulfilled your mission for that war. When all goals in a mission are complete I've accomplished my mission. It's possible that I may have accomplished the mission for now, but the same mission may be required to accomplish once again.
 -  Create your tasks
    - Tasks are the individual steps that add up to one bigger step, that being a goal, or a mission. They help break down goals so that they are accomplishable.
      
      Tasks, most of the time, should associate to a goal, and then that goal should subsequently associate up to a mission, and then that mission should be associated to one of my principles. When all tasks in a goal are complete i should have accomplished that goal. I it's not complete, than why not?
 - Create Reminders / Reinforcers
    - Weekly I review my goals and create tasks that help me achieve those goals in Asana. Those tasks are in the Goal Tasks project. Reminders are great for helping build / form long term habits. For example, a reminder is something that I want to help create as a habit. One example is a reminder I have to fix or accomplish a home related chore at least once a day. Reminders aren't necessarily accomplishable on their own. They are there to help keep me on track with my principles.
